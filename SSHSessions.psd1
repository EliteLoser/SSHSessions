# Module manifest for module 'PSGET_SSHSessions'

# v1.9 - Add -Reconnect to New-SshSession. Standardize output more to Ansible style.
# Some breaking changes if output is parsed, due to this.
# v1.9.1 - Add -ScriptBlock to Invoke-SshCommand.
# v1.9.2 - Bug fixes and improvements. Vastly improved pipeline handling.
# v2.0 - Emit objects instead of strings. Majorly breaking change, but
#        I think it's needed and much better. Have been considering switching
#        to Write-Verbose for a lot of the output and have it quiet, as is
#        the convention, but I imagine that after 6 years in the wild, there are
#        thousands of meta scripts using this module - and some might be parsing
#        the output to determine success. I will look into redesigning and
#        standardizing further. Pushing this for now.
# v2.1 - Standardize completely to Write-Warning, Write-Error and Write-Verbose.
#        Possibly another, recent breaking change.
